#HelloWorld

This is an example repository I put on GitHub
---
This is a **review** of the
- init
- commit
- push
- pull
- add, etc.
functions to and from GitHub through *VSCode*.

This example is also a demonstration of the use of markdown language using the [Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
